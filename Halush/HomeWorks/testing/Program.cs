/*
Create an abstract class CardDeck. Create concrete class StandardCardDeck with 52 card. 
Create class StandardCard to represent single card. 
You need to implement an abstract method GetCard that will return you a random card from deck. 
Try not to create an array. 
Think of how to create card based on any given number.
Hint: You will probably need Math.Floor, casting, and Enums, and Random. 

Example of how to generate a random number between 0 (including) and 52 (excluding): 
Random random = newRandom();
int value = random.Next(0
